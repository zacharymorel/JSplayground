# JS | TS Playground

This is my running practice and other shenanigans of things JavaScript and TypeScript.

Each directory contains files of code by purpose of the exercise and information.
_Absolutely subject to change._
<br>

Installing:

- Good idea to have Node <= v16 install on machine.
- This also assume YOU HAVE node install on your path variable.
- `npm i`

<br>

Running the files:

- From root directory, run the npm ts or js command and pass in the relative path to the file as the first npm argument.
  - I.e. `npm run ts ./sort/bubbleSort.ts` or `npm run js ./dataTransforms/filter.js`

> Go do the thing.
